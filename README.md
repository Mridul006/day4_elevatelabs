We used the Breast Cancer dataset for binary classification with logistic regression. The data was split into training/testing sets and standardized. The model was trained and evaluated using a confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. We also adjusted the decision threshold and explained the sigmoid function, which maps scores to probabilities.
